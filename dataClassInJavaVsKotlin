In java :

public class User {
  public final String firstName;
  public final String lastName;
  public User(String firstName, String lastName) {
      this.firstName = firstName;
      this.lastName = lastName;
  }
}

In Kotlin :
data class User(val firstName: String, val lastName: String)
This type of object has data that never changes. It is common in 
applications to have 
data that is read once and never changes thereafter.
