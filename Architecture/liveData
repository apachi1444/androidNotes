is a class that holds data
life cycle aware 
means that if the ui controller gets destroyed it will not pass the 
data to it

until it will be back to screen !

it s a double relationship between the controller and the liveData
the ui controller is observer for the data
the liveData is the observer for the lifeCycle of the ui controller

so in the ui conroller
// this means that the liveData is observing for the lifeCycle of the ui Controller
binding.score.observe(this , Observer{});
