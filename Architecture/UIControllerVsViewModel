the ui controller only displays and gets user/OS events

viewModel holds data for UI

UIController does not make decisions 

viewModel never reference fragments , activities or views!


for simple data , we can use the onSaveInstanceState() method and restores
its data from the bundle in onCreate() method !
not suitable for small amount of data to 
do the serializing and deserializing 

and also the ui Controller makes to do a lot of asynchronous tasks

val model : MyViewModel by viewModels()

if the activity is re-created it will receive the same 
viewModel that is already created in the first acitivity !


we need to make the ui controller data-driven means : 
its responsability is to update the views as data changes , notify user
actions back to the VIEWMODEL !

Use DataBinding to maintain a clean interface between your views and 
the UICONTROLLER !
make views more declartive
