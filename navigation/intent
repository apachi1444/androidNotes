intent indicates intention of your app!

description of something that the app wants an activity to perform!
system uses to locate activities on behalf of applications

if intents were used to locate grocery sotes in the real world

explicit would be : the description of a specific local convenience store
implicit : describe the store withing five mile radius that sold organic cabbages!


--------------------- 2 types --------------------------

explicit intent !
lauch specific activity !
the navigation do this when go to another acitivities in the nav graph !


implicit intent!
provide abstract description of the operation to be performed 
when multiple android apps can handle the same implicit intent
android will pop up a chooser like this one that contains a list of 
compatible apps so that the user select the desired one to perform the request
--- they are important because app request something from another app 
without having to know anything about the other app


actions are used in intents to describe the type of thing that is to be done
common actions in intent class : view , edit , 

categories and dtattype to further describe the operation !



in the AndroidManifest
explicit uses the acitvity tag
implicit uses the intent filter! means that your activity is exposed to
an implicit intent with a certain action , category , or type 
	
shareIntent.setType("text/plain"): we use the mime type 
to tell android which activities must handle this request

val intent = Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND)
to tell android we want activities that are registred with an !!!!!! intent filter
to handle this request !

startsActivity(getIntent()) ! 
if we have only one activity that can handle this intent , opened automatically
