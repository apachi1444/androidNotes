fragments contain arguments in the form of an android Bundle !

which is key : value store !

also known as dictionary or associative array !

pass data from frag A to frag B

val argBundle = Bundle()

argBundle.putString(NameKeyString , "content")
argBundle.putInt(SERIAL_KEY_INT , 42)

val fragment = Fragment B()
fragement.arguments = argBundle

---------- this is the traditional way


but we have safears which a gradle plugin that generates code 
to guarantee that the arguments on both sides match up !

safe arguments generates nav directions Classes !

the nav Direction will create for us the bundle behind the scene !
