it's a feature that allow us to write code that interacts with views

generates a binding class for each XML Layout 
an instance of class represents all references to all views in the layout 
with their corresponding ID

to make a layout ignored while generating the binding classes
tools:viewBindingIgnore="true"

getRoot() : get ref to the root of the layout in the xml file !


// this will return an instance of the class ResultProfileBinding !
val binding = ResultProfileBinding.inflate(layoutInflater)



<EditText android:id="@+id/user_bio" tools:viewBindingType="TextView" />

will generate a field as TextView !
