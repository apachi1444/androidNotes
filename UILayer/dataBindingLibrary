bindUiComponents in your layouts to data sources in your app
using declarative way

<TextView
    android:text="@{viewmodel.userName}" />


--- Layouts and binding expressions 

the expression language allows you to write expressions that connect vars to the views in the layout
also this expression helps you to handle the events dispatched by the views!

	


Data Binding library generates the classed required to bind the views
in the layout with data objects !!!!

the binding variables that can be used in expressions are defined inside a 
data element

( data is a sibling of the root ! )



<data>
        <variable
            name="viewmodel"
            type="com.myapp.data.ViewModel" />
</data>

and the root should be wrapped into the layout layout
<layout>  <data> <ConstraintLayout>
