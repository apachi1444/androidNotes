working with observable data objects

the dataBindingLibrary provides classes and methods to easily observe data
for changes 
do not worry about refreshing the UI when the data sources changes !

when we use the data binding layout we should use this expression !
val binding = DataBindingUtil.setContentView(this,R.layout....);

use the data binding to avoid null things during the run time execution
