the setContentView does is displaying your UI in the current activity
and inflates it into a view which is added to the activity context
so we can call the findViewById !!!!


DataBindingUtil.setContentView(context , layoutRes)
does all the above plus creating the binding object 
do the findViewById and all other data binding related task under the hood
and gives you directly the binding object
